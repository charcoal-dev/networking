# Charcoal Networking

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A lightweight base library that provides generic networking utilities, starting with IpHelper for validating,
normalizing, and working with IPv4/IPv6 addresses, and optional CidrHelper for parsing and matching IPs against CIDR
ranges. It is framework-agnostic, has no HTTP dependencies, and serves as the foundation for higher-level packages like
http-trust-proxy, keeping low-level network concerns cleanly separated and reusable.

For detailed information, guidance, and setup instructions regarding this library, please refer to our official
documentation website:
